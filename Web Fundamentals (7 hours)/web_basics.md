# Web Basics

## History of the Web

- World Wide Web invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN
- First website went live on August 6, 1991
- Initially designed for information-sharing among physicists worldwide
- First browser "WorldWideWeb" created by Berners-Lee in 1990
- Mosaic browser (1993) made web accessible to general public
- Evolution includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for rich interactive experiences

## Web browsers

- Software applications for accessing and navigating the World Wide Web
- **Examples**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera
- Interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages
- Manage user sessions, store cookies, handle HTTPS security
- Include developer tools for inspecting elements and debugging

## Web Servers

- Systems that store, process, and deliver web pages to clients
- Use HTTP protocol to communicate with web browsers
- Common software: Apache, Nginx, IIS, LiteSpeed
- Serve static content (HTML files) or dynamic content (PHP, Python, Node.js)
- Handle client requests, process them, and return responses

## Website

- Collection of related web pages hosted on a web server
- Can be static (fixed content) or dynamic (real-time content)
- Identified by unique domain names (e.g., example.com)
- Include text, images, videos, and interactive elements
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Static and Dynamic Webpage URL

- URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address for accessing web resources
- **Static webpages**: Fixed content, URLs point to specific files (e.g., `https://example.com/about.html`)
- **Dynamic webpages**: Content generated on-the-fly, URLs include parameters (e.g., `https://example.com/products?id=123`)
- Dynamic URLs change based on user input, session data, or variables for personalized experiences

## URL vs URI

- **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator): Specific URI type that provides means to access web resources
- **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier): Broader term identifying resources by name, location, or both
- All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs
- Example: `https://example.com` (URL) vs `urn:isbn:0451450523` (URI identifying book by ISBN)
- URIs identify resources in various contexts, not just the web
- On web, URI often used interchangeably with URL, but can refer to URNs (Uniform Resource Names)

## Internet

- Global network of interconnected computers using standardized protocols
- Enables data transfer across vast distances worldwide
- Underlying infrastructure for World Wide Web, email, file sharing, and online services
- Consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks
- Operates on decentralized model with no single controlling entity
- Key technologies: TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP
