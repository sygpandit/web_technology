# Architecting Web Applications (Characteristics, pros, and cons)

## Characteristics

1. **Scalability**: Handle increased load through horizontal/vertical scaling
2. **Modularity**: Break applications into smaller, reusable components (microservices)
3. **Interoperability**: Enable different systems to work together via APIs and standards
4. **Security**: Protect against threats through authentication, authorization, encryption

## Pros

- Improved user experience with responsive design and fast loading
- Enhanced maintainability and flexibility with modular architectures
- Better resource utilization and cost savings with cloud/serverless solutions
- Increased security through modern practices and technologies

## Cons

- Complexity in managing microservices and distributed systems
- Potential vendor lock-in with cloud providers and serverless architectures
- Challenges ensuring consistent performance across components
- Need for skilled developers familiar with modern web technologies
