# Overview of Web protocols

- Web protocols are standardized methods for communication over the Internet
- Define how data is transmitted, received, and processed between clients and servers
- Common web protocols include:
- **HTTP**: Foundation of web data communication for transferring pages and resources
- **HTTPS**: HTTP with SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transmission
- **FTP**: Used for transferring files between computers on a network
- **SMTP**: Used for sending emails
- **IMAP/POP3**: Protocols for retrieving emails from a server
- Ensure reliable and secure data transmission for web applications

## HTTP vs HTTPS

- **HTTP**: Standard protocol for web data transfer, operates on port 80, no encryption (vulnerable to attacks)
- **HTTPS**: HTTP with SSL/TLS encryption, operates on port 443, protects data from interception
- HTTPS essential for protecting sensitive information (login credentials, payments, personal data)
- HTTPS sites show padlock icon in browser address bar
- Browsers now mark HTTP sites as "Not Secure" to encourage HTTPS adoption
