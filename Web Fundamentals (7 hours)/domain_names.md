# Domain name and hierarchy

- Human-readable addresses for identifying specific Internet locations
- Structured hierarchically with levels separated by dots (e.g., `www.example.com`)
- **TLD** (Top-Level Domain): Rightmost part indicating domain type (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`)
- **SLD** (Second-Level Domain): Part left of TLD representing the organization (`example` in `example.com`)
- **Subdomains**: Can be added for more specific addresses (`blog.example.com`)
- Managed by domain registrars for registration and maintenance
- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses for browser connection
