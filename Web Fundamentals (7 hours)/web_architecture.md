# Web Architecture

- Design and structure of web applications encompassing client-side and server-side components
- Organization of web technologies, protocols, and data flow for efficient, scalable solutions
- Three main layers:
  1. **Presentation Layer**: Client-side UI/UX using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  2. **Application Layer**: Business logic using server-side languages (Python, Ruby, PHP) and frameworks
  3. **Data Layer**: Data storage and management using databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Considers scalability, security, performance, and maintainability
- May use design patterns, microservices, and APIs for modular components
- Modern concepts: responsive design, PWAs, serverless computing
