# Web Basics

## History of the Web
- The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN.
- The first website went live on August 6, 1991.
- The web was initially designed to meet the increasing demand for information-sharing among physicists in universities
and institutes around the world.
- The first web browser, WorldWideWeb, was created by Berners-Lee in 1990.
- The introduction of graphical web browsers like Mosaic in 1993 made the web more accessible to the general public.
- The web has evolved significantly with the introduction of technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leading to the
rich, interactive experiences we have today.

## Web browsers
- A web browser is a software application used to access information on the World Wide Web.
- Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera.
- Browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages.
- They also manage user sessions, store cookies, and handle security protocols like HTTPS.
- Browsers have developer tools that allow developers to inspect elements, debug JavaScript, and analyze performance.

## Web Servers
- A web server is a system that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients.
- It uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with web browsers.
- Common web server software includes Apache, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed.
- Web servers can serve static content (like HTML files) or dynamic content generated by server-side scripts (like PHP,
Python, or Node.js).
- They handle requests from clients, process them, and return the appropriate responses.

## Website
- A website is a collection of related web pages hosted on a web server.
- Websites can be static (fixed content) or dynamic (content generated in real-time).
- They are typically identified by a unique domain name (like example.com).
- Websites can include various types of content such as text, images, videos, and interactive elements.
- Websites are built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Static and Dynamic Webpage URL
- A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access a specific resource on the web.
- Static webpages have fixed content that does not change unless manually updated. Their URLs typically point to a
specific file on the server (e.g., `https://example.com/about.html`).
- Dynamic webpages generate content on-the-fly based on user interactions or other parameters. Their URLs often include
query strings or parameters (e.g., `https://example.com/products?id=123`).
- Dynamic URLs can change based on user input, session data, or other variables, allowing for personalized experiences.

## URL vs URI
- A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that provides the means to
access a resource on the web.
- A URI is a broader term that can identify a resource by name, location, or both.
- All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.
- For example, `https://example.com` is a URL that specifies the location of a resource, while `urn:isbn:0451450523` is
a URI that identifies a book by its ISBN without providing a means to access it.
- More generally, a URI can be used to identify resources in various contexts, not just on the web.
- URI on web is often used interchangeably with URL, but it can also refer to other types of identifiers like URNs
(Uniform Resource Names) that do not specify a location.

## Internet
- The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols.
- It enables the transfer of data and resources across vast distances, allowing users to access information and services
from anywhere in the world.
- The Internet is the underlying infrastructure that supports the World Wide Web, email, file sharing, and many other
online services.
- It consists of a vast array of networks, including private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
- The Internet operates on a decentralized model, meaning no single entity controls it, allowing for a diverse range of
services and applications to flourish.
- Key technologies that enable the Internet include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), DNS
(Domain Name System), and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).


#Overview of Web protocols
- Web protocols are standardized methods for communication over the Internet.
- They define how data is transmitted, received, and processed between clients (like web browsers) and servers.
- Common web protocols include:
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The foundation of data communication on the web, used for transferring web
pages and resources.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**: An extension of HTTP that uses encryption (SSL/TLS) to secure data transmission between
clients and servers.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Used for sending emails.
- **IMAP/POP3**: Protocols used for retrieving emails from a server.
- These protocols ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely, enabling the functionality of web applications
and services.

## HTTP vs HTTPS
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the standard protocol for transferring data over the web. It operates on
port 80 and does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** is an extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmission. It operates
on port 443 and ensures that the data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted, protecting it from
interception and tampering.
- HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as login credentials, payment details, and personal
data, making it a critical component of web security.
- Websites using HTTPS are indicated by a padlock icon in the browser's address bar, signaling that the connection is
secure.
- The transition from HTTP to HTTPS has become increasingly important, with many browsers marking HTTP sites as "Not
Secure" to encourage the adoption of secure connections.

#Domain name and hierarchy
- A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify a specific location on the Internet, making it easier for
users to access websites without needing to remember numerical IP addresses.
- Domain names are structured hierarchically, consisting of multiple levels separated by dots (e.g, `www.example.com`).
- The rightmost part of the domain name is called the top-level domain (TLD), which indicates the type or category of
the domain (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`).
- The second-level domain (SLD) is the part immediately to the left of the TLD and typically represents the organization
or entity that owns the domain (e.g., `example` in `example.com`).
- Subdomains can be added to the left of the SLD to create more specific addresses (e.g., `blog.example.com`).
- Domain names are managed by domain registrars, which allow individuals and organizations to register and maintain
their domain names.
- The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling browsers to locate and connect to web
servers hosting the corresponding websites.
